# A Pricing Model for the Tasks of Taking Photographs
This is a topic we chose for the purpose of training for *the national contest of mathematic modelling*. In the paper, we intended to develop a pricing model for the crowdsourcing service.

This is a teamwork. My teammates are Zhiheng Zhang and Wenyao Li.

The puzzle contains 4 questions. Z. Zhang and I tried different approaches and answered these four questions independently.

In the paper, the most notable contributions of mine are:

1. To point out that, in the equilibrium state, the prices of the items should be of equal appeal to the consumers: if item A is more appealing to the consumers than item B, then the consumers will choose item A over item B. As the demands of item A is more than the demands of item B, the price of item A will go up and the price of item B will go down until the price of item A is as appealing to the consumers as the price of item B. Hence, I deduced that in the equilibrium state, the prices of the items should be of equal appeal to the consumers so that the consumers will show no preference for one item over another and each item has the same chance of being purchased.

2. By applying the principle of maximum entropy, I figured out that the total transaction costs is a measurement of the difference between the distribution of the consumers and the distribution of the commodities.
